# Anomaly-Detection
Detection of inconsistencies between rating and review for Amazon products.

The review and rating are crucial in the performance of a product in a website. 

1 review results in 10% higher sales. 
Each rating is important for the average rating. 
Sometimes people mistake 1 star as the best or 5 stars as the worst. Maybe by mistake they had given a good review but a bad rating and vice versa.
It happens so there are inconsistencies between the rating and the review. 
These are anomalies and the goal of this project is to train a model so that it can identify anomalies using the review text, review title and rating. So that any review when it comes can be checked if it isn't contradicting the rating given.
The user giving this review can then be notified of the situation so as to edit their review or rating as they see fit. 
This will help customers look at the real rating of the product.
